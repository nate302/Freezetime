FreezeTime allows you to freeze the time on certain worlds. Every 5 seconds, worlds with FreezeTime enabled go back 5 seconds, so it keeps it within 5 seconds of the time while not causing any lag. It works with /time and multiverse plugins.

This plugin was written by and is maintained by aidanwolk. This repo was made as an easy way to update the source for compiling with Jenkins.
